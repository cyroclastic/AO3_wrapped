# AO3_wrapped
files for ao3 wrapped

## TL:DR Guide
1) Go to this link [Google Colab code link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uNLVq03i03khZmaVklhzo4VD02xnTKNX?usp=sharing)

2) After you put your password in the quotes in box that says:
```
username ="" #Please enter your username in between the quotation marks. DO NOT remove the quotation marks!
pwd = ""  ##Do the same with your password, then run the cell
```
> ^ You can `ctrl + F` to find it if you need.

3) Then click on `Runtime` at the top bar and hit `Run All`

4) Wait a bit for the code to run and summarize stuff

5) You download your results from the folder on the left (not the output box I got confused there lol)

> OPTIONAL: If you want to do it on a copy of the file you can click `File` then `Save a Copy in Drive` and voila you have your own copy.

## Changes made
NOTE: THIS FORK IS A MODIFICATION TO CHANGE THE YEAR I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THE CODE OR DESIGNS

- Changed the year in the code to check your 2024 fics
- Changed the source pic repo to one that has the 2024 pic (ps sorry the canva font didn't match perfectly :/)

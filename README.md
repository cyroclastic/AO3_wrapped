## TL:DR Guide
[Google Colab code link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uNLVq03i03khZmaVklhzo4VD02xnTKNX?usp=sharing)

After you put your password in the quotes in box that says:
```
username ="" #Please enter your username in between the quotation marks. DO NOT remove the quotation marks!
pwd = ""  ##Do the same with your password, then run the cell
```

You download your results from the folder on the left (not the output box I got confused there lol)
